Java adaptation of PHP WA API by venomous0x.

Original PHP version is found here: https://github.com/venomous0x/WhatsAPI

Now moved to following the more current version here: https://github.com/mgp25/WhatsAPI-Official

## Testing

There is an example command line application which currently has 3 supported functions:
	* request - Requests an SMS for registration
	* register - Registers a code received by SMS
	* send - Sends a message to a user

You can run the example with:
$ java -cp target/dependency/*:target/whatsapi4j-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar net.sumppen.whatsapi4j.example.ExampleApplication 358401122333 'mypassword' 'mytestapplication' 'My Test Account'

If you want to request an SMS or register a code, you need to leave the password field blank
